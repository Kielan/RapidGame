# Add the source files you want to ignore to this file. When
# you make your project, only C/C++ (.c, .cpp, .cc, .cxx)
# files will be considered source files, and they must all
# be stored in `Projects`. Other files such as .m and .mm
# files will be automatically ignored. When you build your
# .apk again using make, the files you have changed since your
# previous build will automatically be updated for the build
# list. Your source filenames may not contain any spaces.
#
# Enter your files in the following format:
# (feel free to add newlines as you wish)
#
# Outdated_class.cpp
# no_spaces_allowed.cpp
#
# some_c_file.c
#
# Old_file_dont_delete.cpp
