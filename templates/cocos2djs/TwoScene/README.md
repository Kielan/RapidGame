  Congratulations on creating a cocos2d-js game!
  Run it by opening the Xcode project in `Projects`.
  Or, the HTML5 version by running `cd Server && node server.js` and browsing to: http://localhost:8000
  Or, for Android, see the README in `Projects/android`
  Ready to code? Start with the `Assets/GameScene.js` file.
  Do `rapidgame prebuild` to prepare cocos2d-x libraries.
