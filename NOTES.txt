Notes for Windows by Sam
------------------------
build.sh = rapidgame/src/proj.android/build.sh

Add to README:

- The very first "rapidgame create cocos2dx ..." command MUST be run in an admin cygwin console on Windows to create latest as a symlink
	-> If this is not done, latest will be created as a regular folder, and the library files will be stored in "latst" instead of the intended folder
- (Both Mac and Win) Android SDK's APIs must be downloaded for the target platform and for the minimum supported platform
	-> TwoScene's current default target is API 18, and the minimum is API 10
	-> This can be done by going to Android Studio -> Configure -> SDK Manager -> [Select and install appropriate packages]

Technical details:

- The reason I believe cygwin must be installed in the root directory is that build.sh replaces "/cygwin/c" with "C:" for the src and dest paths
- The Windows TwoScene template project still does not compile

Future fixes:

- Running make for the TwoScene template for Android does not work on Windows currently, but the project can easily be built and installed
	-> I will try to find a reasonable solution for this ASAP
