- README note: Path to rapidgame for Windows
- README note: "rapidgame create" must be run in admin console for Windows (to create symlink)
- README note: Android SDK must be downloaded for the target platform and for the minimal supported platform (currently API 10 and 18)
- README note: Windows users must install cygwin
- Windows project still does not compile (2 unresolved externals)
- Does make when building the TwoScene example work in cygwin?

How to build library for Debug-Android (armeabi) on Windows atm:
- (cygwin) go to rapidgame/src/proj.android, run make
- Comment out code for ndk-build
- Switch to Git Bash
- Run make again

- Running ant when building Android TwoScenes created some folders under rapidgame/0.9.7/cocos2d/x/java/cocos2d-x - look into?
- Was latest supposed to be an alias/symlink for the most recent version (is it that way on Mac? (go check))
- Does running the regular make in cygwin when building Android TwoScenes work instead of needing modified makefile?
- There's gotta be more to remember and try out
