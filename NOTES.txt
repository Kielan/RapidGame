Notes for Windows by Sam
------------------------
Don't forget:

- Update CHANGELOG.txt

Add to README:

- Android is now fully capable on Windows!
- There is no longer any 64-bit requirement for Windows
- The very first "rapidgame create cocos2dx ..." command MUST be run in an admin cygwin console on Windows to create latest as a symlink
	-> If this is not done, latest will be created as a regular folder, and the library files will be stored in "latst" instead of the intended folder
- (Both Mac and Win) Android SDK's APIs must be downloaded for the target platform and for the minimum supported platform
	-> TwoScene's current default target is API 18, and the minimum is API 10
	-> This can be done by going to Android Studio -> Configure -> SDK Manager -> [Select and install appropriate packages]

Technical details:

- The reason I believe cygwin must be installed in the root directory is that build.sh replaces "/cygwin/c" with "C:" for the src and dest paths
	-> If cygwin isn't installed for all users (root), then cygwin's path to C: may change, but that may not be the case.
	-> This could be resolved if someone wants to install cygwin for their user only and tests if the Android libraries are still able to be built
- The Windows TwoScene template project still does not compile

Future fixes:

- Running make for the TwoScene template for Android does not work on Windows currently, but the project can easily be built and installed
	-> I will try to find a reasonable solution for this ASAP
