Notes for Windows by Sam
------------------------
build.sh = rapidgame/src/proj.android/build.sh

Don't forget:

- You will have to update the hardcoded paths for ar and strip in build.sh as newer NDK versions come out
	-> Go into cygwin and type "ndk-which ar" and "ndk-which strip" to find which paths to use
- Until rapidgame/latest is created as a symlink for Windows, the newest version number must be replaced in dest's path in build.sh

Add to README:

- rapidgame is installed at C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\rapidgame on Windows
- "rapidgame create" must be run in an admin console if on Windows (to create the lib symlink)
	-> If someone runs create in a regular console, run "rapidgame init [PROJECT_DIR]" in a root console and everything will be fine
- (Both Mac and Win) Android SDK's APIs must be downloaded for the target platform and for the minimum supported platform
	-> TwoScene's current default target is API 18, and the minimum is API 10
	-> This can be done by going to Android Studio -> Configure -> SDK Manager -> [Select and install appropriate packages]
- If using Windows, then it must be a 64-bit machine at the moment (possibly easy fix in the future, see below)
- If using Windows, you must download and install cygwin (64-bit)
	-> It is very likely that cygwin must be installed in the root directory (C:\cygwin64), which is the recommended option (see below)
	-> The "Devel" category of packages should probably be downloaded in addition to the defaults when running setup
- Credit :D

Technical details:

- The reason 64-bit Windows is required is because the ar and strip paths are hardcoded to look in that directory in build.sh
	-> There might be an external variable that contains info about what version that OS is
	-> Maybe lines 71 and 84 can be rewritten with this variable to very easily fix the issue
	-> The problem is Android NDK only installs the prebuilt applications in toolchains for your host OS
		=> e.g. [NDK_ROOT]/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.8/prebuilt only contains windows-x86_64 for me
- The reason I believe cygwin must be installed in the root directory is that build.sh replaces "/cygwin/c" with "C:" for the src and dest paths
- I haven't double-checked yet but IIRC rapidgame/latest is supposed to be a symlink to the lastest version. This is not the case for Windows.
	-> Windows creates a normal folder called latest, which means dest must be hardcoded to the most recent version path in build.sh
	-> See "Don't forget"
- The Windows TwoScene template project still does not compile

Future fixes:

- Running make for the TwoScene template for Android does not work on Windows currently, but the project can easily be built and installed
	-> I will try to find a reasonable solution for this ASAP
- Find the external/environment variable that allows ar and strip to be found on 32-bit Windows?
